# Drishti-The-Blind-Assistent-Web-App

# Description
It is a web application to help blind people by detecting objects and give the information like the object name, it's distance. This app can detect objects using webcam or using video also.

# Dataset
This is a pre-trained model using yolov3 which uses coco dataset.

# Tech Stack

- Language : Python

- Algorithm : YOLO V3

- API : Google Text to Speech using gtts

- Web Framework : Flask

# Output
As a output, this model gives feedback about the object in voice format which helps visually impared.
I have uploaded the demo video in the repository itself.

# Future Work
- It is working on the local system. This can be deploy in the cloud.

- We can use latest YOLO version to get more efficient results.
